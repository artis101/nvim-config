# My Neovim Configuration

This is my custom Neovim configuration, utilizing various plugins to enhance the development experience. The setup includes a focus on LSP, file management, markdown rendering, and color schemes. Below is an overview of the plugins and their configuration.

Refer to the [ðŸ’¤ LazyVim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Installation

To use this configuration, clone it into your Neovim config directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/artis101/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

Ensure you have the latest version of Neovim installed. For the plugin manager, I'm using lazy.nvim, but you can adjust it to fit your own setup.
